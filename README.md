# Assignment 1: Basic Python Concepts

## task 1:

### steps performed:
1: input function takes a number from the user which is then converted into int data type and stored in variable named a
2: same process is repeated and the number is stored in variable named b
3: first print statement outputs addition of the two numbers which are stored in a and b
4: second print statement outputs subtraction of the two numbers
5: third print statement outputs multiplication of the two numbers
6: fourth print statement outputs division of the two numbers  

### explanation:
the input from the user is in string thus it needs to be first converted to integers so as to perfrom arithmetic operations
f is used within the print statements to output the result from the arithmetic operations

## task 2

### steps performed:
1: input function takes first name of the user which is stored in variable called first_name
2: input function takes last name of the user which is stored in variable called last_name
3: print statements concatenates the first_name and last_name variables

### explanation
since the input from the user is already string it can be concatenated in the print statement
